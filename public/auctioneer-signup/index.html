            <strong>USER AGREEMENT</strong>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:center;">
            <strong>SHARP AUCTION ENGINE</strong>
          </p>
          <p>This Agreement contains terms and conditions applicable to your use of the live auction services we host as well as your participation in live auction events conducted by an Auction House and Auctioneers. By using the services on any Sharp Auction
            Engine website (i.e. www.sharpauctionengine.com and any other related websites where this Agreement appears), you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions, including those available by hyperlink, with Sharp Auction Engine as well
            as our subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>
          <p>Before you may become a member of Sharp Auction Engine, you must read and accept all of the terms and conditions in, and referenced by, this Agreement and our Privacy Policy (whether such terms and conditions are contained in the primary document
            itself or are hyperlinked to related documents). We strongly recommend that, as you read this Agreement, you also access and read all linked information, as well as the listing of Auction Lingo. Some Sharp Auction Engine-branded websites,
            or sites that we operate, may also be governed by separate user agreements and privacy policies that you should also read.</p>
          <p>You acknowledge and agree that we may amend this Agreement at any time, and from time to time, by posting the amended terms on our website. Unless, and only to the extent, expressly stated to the contrary herein, all amended terms and conditions
            shall automatically be effective on a prospective basis once they are posted on our site. Accordingly, you are encouraged to periodically review our terms of use for any such changes and/or amendments.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>LIVE AUCTION AGREEMENT</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong>. Each Auction House that conducts a live auction will have its own eligibility requirements that must be met in order for you to participate in that auction. You may be required to apply for and obtain approval in order
              to participate in a specific live auction. Approval to participate in one live auction does not guarantee approval to participate in any other live auction, conducted either by that Auction House, or another Auction House. Each Auction House
              has sole and absolute discretion to refuse to approve your eligibility for any live auction.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>FEES</strong>. Each Auction House may charge a buyer's premium (which is an additional fee that a winning bidder is required to pay above the auction price) as well as shipping, handling, and other fees. These fees are subject to change
              depending upon the Auction House and the particular item for sale, and are set by the Auction House.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>SHARP AUCTION ENGINE IS ONLY A VENUE.</strong>
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Services</strong>. We are not an auction house and are not conducting the live auctions. Our service allows you to participate in live auctions conducted by the Auction House. We are solely a passive conduit to facilitate communication
                  between you and the Auction House. We reserve the right in our sole and absolute discretion to change some or all of our services at any time.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Control</strong>. We have no control over the quality, safety, or legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, or the ability of the Auction House to sell and the ability of buyers to buy items. We also do
                  not ensure or guarantee that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Compliance with Laws</strong>. You acknowledge and agree that the use, purchase, distribution, promotion, advertising, and sale of certain products are subject to federal state, and local regulations, including, but not limited to, firearms,
                  Indian artifacts, recalled products, children's products, alcoholic beverages, coins and currency. You further acknowledge and agree that Sharp Auction Engine’s role with respect to the sale of products is limited to providing a conduit
                  through which a prospective purchaser is able to participate in an auction. Sharp Auction Engine does not review or evaluate the products auctioned, or verify the descriptions given or claims made, by Auction Houses regarding the products.
                  You expressly represent that you shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations relating to your use, purchase, and distribution of any products that you bid upon or purchase through
                  Sharp Auction Engine (hereinafter, the "Regulations"), including, but not limited to, (i) the Gun Control Act of 1968 and all regulations promulgated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (collectively, the "Firearms
                  Regulations"), (ii) the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and all regulations promulgated by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission, and (iii) the Indian Arts &amp; Crafts Act of 1990 and any additional laws and
                  regulations applicable to the sale of Indian arts and crafts. You shall at all times defend, indemnify and hold Sharp Auction Engine, its shareholders, members, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, parent, subsidiaries,
                  affiliates, joint venturers, and successors and assigns, harmless from, and against, any and all causes of action, suits, claims, demands, judgments, liabilities, losses, damages, awards, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including,
                  but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees) of any nature or kind, arising under or resulting from: (i) your use, purchase, or distribution of any products in violation of any Regulations; (ii) your use of Sharp Auction Engine in
                  connection with the purchase of any products subject to any Regulations; and (iii) your alleged or actual violation or breach of any Regulations.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Release</strong>. Since we are not involved in the actual transactions between buyers and Auction Houses, in the event that you have a dispute with an Auction House, you hereby release Sharp Auction Engine (and our shareholders, members,
                  partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, joint venturers, and successors and assigns) from causes of action, suits, claims, demands, judgments, and damages (actual and consequential) of every
                  kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of, or in any way connected with, such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code § 1542, as amended
                  from time to time, and any similar statutes, to the extent that such statute(s) prohibits a general release from extending to claims that a creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his/her favor at the time of executing the release,
                  which if known by the creditor, would materially affect his/her settlement with the debtor.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AUCTION HOUSES</strong>. The Auction House will list available items on which you may bid. Auction dates and times, as well as the number, character, and order and schedule of the items to be auctioned, are set by the Auction House and are
              subject to change without notice. Individual lots and items may be modified or changed at any time. Some lots and items that are made available on the auction floor will not be included in the online live auction services. We do not control
              the information that is provided by the Auction House, which is made available through our system. We also do not guarantee that the Auction House maintains proper auctioneers' licenses or complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>BIDDING, BUYING AND CONDITIONS OF SALE</strong>. The terms and conditions for participation in each auction, including how bids are accepted, rules governing absentee bids, bid increments, bid retraction and cancellation, the conditions
              the buyer must meet to purchase an item, as well as the specific conditions of sale (such as warranties, shipping costs, insurance, and the like) may change for each auction at the sole discretion of the Auction House. The Auction House
              is required to post its terms and conditions and to maintain such terms throughout the auction period. You agree to be bound by those bidding terms and conditions of sale by agreeing to this Agreement. This Agreement, in addition to those
              Auction House terms and conditions, governs your bidding activity, as well as your participation in each auction. The Auction House acts as an auctioneer and makes the sole, final determination with respect to bidding on the item, the sale
              of the item, and the resolution of any disputes.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>AUDIO AND VIDEO</strong>. Any audio or video aspects of a live auction event are for entertainment purposes only.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>USE OF IMAGES</strong>. Sharp Auction Engine has the right to use, on its website and in advertising and promotional materials, images (including photographic images) of items being sold or that have been sold on its website, including images
              of items which have been purchased through the site.</li>
            <li>

            <li>
              <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>. We and our suppliers provide our web site and services “as is” and without any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory. WIthout limiting the foregoing, we do not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted
              or error free, or that bids will be received by the Auction House or information regarding current price will be transmitted in a timely fashion, nor do we guarantee the performance of any obligations by an Auction House. We and our suppliers
              specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.Some states' laws may not allow a disclaimer of implied warranties in certain circumstances, in which case the
              foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you also may have other legal rights which vary from state to state.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>LIABILITY LIMIT</strong>. In no event shall we or our suppliers be liable for lost profits or any special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages arising out of, or in connection with, our sites, our services, the failure of any bid

              tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise), our liability, and the liability of our suppliers, to you or any third parties in any circumstance is limited to the greater of (a) the amount of fees you pay to us in the 12 months
              prior to the action giving rise to liability, and (b) $100.00. Some states’ laws may not allow a limitation of liability in certain circumstances, in which case the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>NOTICES</strong>. Any notice, demand, request or other communication which you may desire or be required to give to Sharp Auction Engine hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested (with postage
              prepaid), or by Federal Express or other similar overnight delivery service (with fees prepaid), to Sharp Auction Engine, 2310 Whitesburg Drive Suite 7, Huntsville, AL 35801, or at any other address that we may designate in writing in the
              future. Any notice, demand, request or other communication which we may desire or be required to give to you hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by email to the email address you provided to Sharp Auction Engine during the registration
              process, or by certified mail, return receipt requested (with postage prepaid), or by Federal Express or other similar overnight delivery service (with fees prepaid), to you at the address you provided to Sharp Auction Engine during the
              registration process. All notices given by e-mail shall be deemed given as of 5:00 P.M. eastern standard time on the business day following the day of transmission. All notices given by mail shall be deemed to have been given three (3) business
              days after mailing and all notices delivered by overnight delivery service shall be deemed given when delivered.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>FORCE MAJEURE</strong>. No party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing any obligation under this Agreement that is due to a Force Majeure event, such as Acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, storm, hurricane or
              other natural disaster), war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (regardless of whether war is declared), civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power or confiscation, terrorist activities, nationalization,
              government sanction, blockage, embargo, labor dispute, strike, lockout or interruption or failure of electricity or telephone service). If a Force Majeure event occurs, the affected party will notify the other party and make commercially
              reasonable efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of the Force Majeure event on the performance of this Agreement. However, this provision does not excuse your obligation to pay for services actually received.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>ARBITRATION</strong>. If a dispute, controversy, claim or cause of action arises out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or any breach or alleged breach thereof (the "Dispute"), and if the Dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions,
              we mutually agree to endeavor first to settle the Dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Procedures then in effect (or under any other form of mediation mutually acceptable
              to the parties involved) before resorting to arbitration. Any unresolved controversy or claim relating to the Dispute shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial
              Arbitration Rules then in effect (or under any other form of arbitration mutually acceptable to the parties involved), and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. If all parties
              to the Dispute agree, a mediator involved in the parties' mediation may be asked to serve as the arbitrator. The mediation and arbitration, if any, shall take place in the City, State, and County of Alabama (unless another location is mutually
              agreed to by the parties involved). Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive upon the parties. The costs and expenses of the mediation and arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties, provided, however, that the arbitrator
              shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the mediation and arbitration. If the arbitrator determines that a party was the prevailing party on
              some but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the arbitrator may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the mediation and arbitration.
              In the event this mediation/arbitration provision is found to be completely unenforceable or inapplicable for any reason, then any dispute, controversy, claim or cause of action arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or any

              <strong>GENERAL</strong>. (a) This Agreement constitutes and sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements, understandings,
              undertakings, negotiations, promises, discussions, warranties or covenants that are not specifically contained herein; (b) The headings, sections, or titles of the various paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted merely for the purpose
              of convenience and do not expressly or by implication or intention, limit, define, extend or affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or the specific terms or text of the section so designated. All personal pronouns used in
              this Agreement shall include the other genders, whether used in the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, and the singular shall include the plural and vice versa, whenever, and as often as may be, appropriate; (c) This Agreement shall be
              governed in all respects, whether as to validity, construction, interpretation, capacity, performance or otherwise, by the laws of the State of Alabama, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws; (d) If any provision of this Agreement
              is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such provision shall be deemed stricken herefrom and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain at all times in full force and effect. Such invalid or enforceable
              provision shall, to the extent legally permitted, be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that comes closest to the parties' intent underlying the invalid or unenforceable provision; (e) It is understood that any accrued but unpaid
              financial obligations, and any other terms related to such financial obligations, shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement; (f) No waiver of any breach, privilege or provision of this Agreement will be construed as a
              waiver of any rights or remedies arising from any other or future breach, privilege or provision; (g) We may, in our sole discretion, assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement to a third party.</li>
